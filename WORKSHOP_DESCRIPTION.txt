[h1]For Modders: Add Your Own Carts![/h1]

SaucedCarts provides a simple API for other mods to add custom cart types. Your carts automatically get all the features - context menus, animations, MP sync, durability, and world spawning.

[h2]Quick Example[/h2]
[code]
-- In your mod's shared/init.lua
SaucedCarts.registerCart("MyMod.Wheelbarrow", {
    name = "Wheelbarrow",
    capacity = 40,
    weightReduction = 80,
    runSpeedModifier = 0.80,
    spawnLocations = {"GardenStoreMisc", "FarmStorageShed"},
})
[/code]

That's it! Your wheelbarrow now works with all SaucedCarts systems.
